<h3>Success is largely a matter of holding on after others have let go!</h3>
<ul>
<li>A year from now you may wish you had started today.</li>
<li>The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.</li>
<li>Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out.</li>
<li>I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.</li>
<li>If people did not do silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.</li>
<li>Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t ever play yourself. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, I’m just getting started. <a href="https://tielabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surround yourself with angels</a>, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. I’m up to something. They don’t want us to win. Mogul talk. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it.</p>
<h3>Action is the foundational key to all success</h3>
